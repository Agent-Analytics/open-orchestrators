# Open Orchestrators

> A selectively curated list of open-source and orchestration-first AI agent products, frameworks, and company operating systems.

[Website](https://openorchestrators.org/) • [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

Open Orchestrators is intentionally narrow. It is not a general AI tools list. Projects belong here when orchestration is the product, not a side feature.

- [Gas Town](https://github.com/gastownhall/gastown) ([GitHub](https://github.com/gastownhall/gastown)) - Multi-agent workspace manager for Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Gemini, and other coding agents with persistent work tracking.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome if the project clearly fits the directory scope.

- Add or update entries in [`src/data/orchestrators.ts`](./src/data/orchestrators.ts).
- Prefer official website, docs, and GitHub links.
- Keep summaries factual, concise, and based on public sources.
- If you add a project, include the source you used to verify it.

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full review criteria.

## Local Development

This repo contains a small Astro site for [`openorchestrators.org`](https://openorchestrators.org/).

```bash
cd open-orchestrators.org
npm install
npm run dev
```

Most editorial updates should happen in [`src/data/orchestrators.ts`](./src/data/orchestrators.ts), which is the source of truth for directory entries, rank order, notes, tags, and links.
