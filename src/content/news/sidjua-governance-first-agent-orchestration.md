SIDJUA has been added to the Open Orchestrators directory as a governance-first AI agent orchestration platform. Its public repository describes the project as an agent platform where governance is enforced by architecture, and the official site positions SIDJUA Free as a self-hosted governance layer for controlling, budgeting, and auditing agents before they act.

This matters for Open Orchestrators readers because SIDJUA focuses on a part of orchestration that many agent tools leave outside the runtime: policy enforcement. The documented model includes a pre-action pipeline for forbidden actions, approvals, budgets, classification, and policy checks, plus divisions, tiers, audit trails, governed daemons, scheduling, and multi-channel messaging.

For operators and builders, the practical signal is that SIDJUA belongs on the watchlist for enterprise-shaped agent operations that still need to run on local or self-hosted machines. The README documents Docker, npm global install, and source-build paths; its platform matrix lists full CLI, REST API, Docker, and web management console support across Linux, macOS, Windows WSL2, and Windows native, with Linux-only sandboxing falling back to `none` on macOS and native Windows.

The Open Orchestrators player note now frames SIDJUA around a first measurement loop: a SIDJUA-governed orchestrator agent decides a signup CTA should change, a coding agent applies the change under SIDJUA policy, approval, budget, and audit controls, the site reports page views and signup events to Agent Analytics, and a SIDJUA-governed agent later fetches the data for the business owner. The useful question is not only whether the agent was allowed to act; it is what happened to visits, sources, CTA clicks, signup starts, completed signups, conversion rate, and drop-off after the governed change shipped.

The current public release is `v1.0.1`. The public roadmap says `v1.1.0` is planned for April 18, 2026, with a security-hardening pass, native LLM tool calling, webhook inbound, blue/green update infrastructure, Prometheus/Grafana observability, a versioned migration system, and an i18n rebuild. Treat the roadmap items as planned scope until the release lands.

Source confidence: High for the current repository, website, installation docs, and `v1.0.1` release. Medium for roadmap items because they describe planned work.
