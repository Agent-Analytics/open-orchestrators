Superset published `desktop-v1.5.4` on 2026-04-15T04:46:05Z. The release is small in marketing shape but meaningful for operators running many coding agents at once: it adds a paginated branch picker with checkout and open actions, moves the v2 diff viewer into its own tab, restores terminal file-link behavior, refines hotkeys, accepts MCP resource URLs as OAuth audiences, and unifies v2 workspace deletion through the host service.

This matters for Open Orchestrators readers because Superset is not only an editor shell. Its public positioning is a local control plane for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor Agent, Gemini CLI, and other CLI-based coding agents running across isolated git worktrees. In that frame, branch discovery, checkout, diff review, terminal links, pane focus, and workspace lifecycle controls are the operator surface.

The clearest addition is the branch picker work from pull request #3397. Superset says the new picker uses cursor pagination, server-side branch and worktree filtering, recency ordering, and row-level actions. In practice, that gives operators a cleaner path to either check out a branch into a Superset-managed worktree or open an existing workspace without making every agent task start from a prompt-generated branch.

The diff-view change from pull request #3420 also fits the same pattern. Clicking a changed file from the changes sidebar can now open or focus a dedicated diff tab instead of taking over the active editor. For a product built around parallel agent work, that is a control-plane improvement: review can become a stable workspace of its own while agents continue producing changes elsewhere.

For builders using Agent Analytics, the measurement loop stays project-facing. Superset can help a team ship more quickly, but the implementation path is not the outcome. Agent Analytics measures whether the work people ship turns into visitors, signups, activation, retention, conversion, or growth across the website, docs, onboarding flow, app, or demo.

Example task:

```text
Compare the last 7 days against the prior 7 days. Report visits, sources, conversion, signup, activation, retention, and the largest drop-off. Tell me which shipped page, docs path, onboarding step, app screen, or demo is creating growth, and what I should improve next.
```
