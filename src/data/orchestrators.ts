    overview: [
      "SIDJUA is an AGPL-licensed, governance-first AI agent orchestration platform for running agents with structural policy enforcement instead of relying only on prompts.",
      "It belongs in Open Orchestrators because its core product surface is the operating layer around agents: divisions, tiers, pre-action enforcement, budgets, approval workflows, classification checks, governed daemons, multi-channel messaging, and audit trails.",
      "The project roadmap expands that control-plane direction with native tool calling, webhook inbound, observability, MCP client integration, MCP server mode, consent and tool-call governance, and enterprise isolation work."
